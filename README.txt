===========

Grid Sim provides a Linear Program based solution for different types
of energy sources.  It mainly differs from other simulators in that it
uses actual hour-by-hourprofile data for non-dispatchable sources,
such as wind and solar.  This allows for more reliable simulation than
simple LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) simulations which assume the
fungibility of energy.  E.g. An LCOE analysis wouldn't consider that
solar power cannot provide power in the darkest of night.
